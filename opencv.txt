opencv is the python library which is use for image processing
and also we need numpy

here, in this project we gonna make use of these libraries to detect the face from the image
but remember
only opencv is not enough
you also need something called Haar Cascade

what is Haar Cascade ?
this is a classifier which is use to detect perticular objects from the source
AND...
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is the haar cascade designed by opencv to detect the frontal face
Basically,
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml this is a required trained classifier for face detection
for detecting anything other need to use different classifier
